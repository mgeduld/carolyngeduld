[Order](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B08B1LV1RX&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_nTSsFbS4V1DB1) my first novel, *Take Me Out The Back*.
## Work in Progress 

My second novel is *Who Shall Live.* Why has a four-year-old girl and her grandmother disappeared from a Jewish community in a small Indiana university town in 2004? Are they hidden in the nearby mystical forest? Will they offer a woodland refuge to townspeople fleeing the virus in 2020? And what is the crime that marks the two women and so many members of the community between the years 2004 and 2035?.
