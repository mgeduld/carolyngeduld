### Advanced Praise

"A truly unique and chilling account of a mass killing as seen through the eyes of many." -Sublime Book Review

"TAKE ME OUT THE BACK is a taut, engrossing and talented debut novel that provides a mosaic of perspectives on a mental health horror story." -IndieReview
### My Work in Progress

"Who Shall Live: a Novel"

Why are firstborn children disappearing from the Jewish Community in a small Indiana university town in the time of Covid-19? Are they hidden in the surrounding forest? Why are so many others in the Community suffering from the fates listed in an ancient Jewish poem, Unetaneh Tokef?

"Oblivious: Stories of Racism and White Privilege"
### My Background

I am a mental health professional in Bloomington, Indiana, originally from NewYork City. I have degrees from The City College of New York and Indiana University.
